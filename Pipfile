# `import-xml` removes the database and builds a new one from the start,
# it shouldn't be used because we are waiting for a well structured new database

# example usage: pipenv run import-xml CreeDictionary/res/dictionaries/ --multi-process 2

# Supply `-m|--multi-processing N` to speed up
# Extra arguments will be passed to subcommand `build-test-db` of `manage-db`, use `manage-db build-test-db -h` to see
# detailed help
# It takes about half a minute with -m 2
# example usage: `pipenv run build-test-db -m 2`
