"""
We build definition vectors so that we can find relevant definitions, and then
later display the associated wordforms. Unfortunately we don’t currently have
any stable ID fields that we can use to refer to the wordform that the
definition came from. If we used the auto-generated wordform id pk, that would
become invalid whenever the dictionary was updated.

To deal with that, this file has functions to turn definitions into string keys that:
 1. Are unique per definition, so we can save multiple definitions per wordform
    into a KeyedVector
 2. Also refer unambiguously to a single wordform.
