## Test files for import process

The data in here is **NOT linguistically correct**. Itâ€™s been tweaked in
arbitrary ways to test what the importer would do if you made arbitrary changes
to the input data.

It would have been better to use sample data not related to a specific language,
with a stubbed or special-purpose FST, as CreeDictionary.paradigm.test_manager
does.
