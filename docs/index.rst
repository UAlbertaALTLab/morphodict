   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to morphodict's documentation!
======================================

Morphodict is the `University of Alberta
ALTLab <https://altlab.ualberta.ca>`_’s intelligent dictionary application.
It currently powers the `itwêwina Plains Cree
Dictionary <https://itwewina.altlab.app>`_, with support for additional
languages in development.

The project is open-source, with the code currently hosted at
<https://github.com/UAlbertaALTLab/morphodict>.

This documentation is mainly targeted at computational linguists, and/or
general linguists with some enthusiasm for programming, who are trying to
get the code running on their local machines so that they can:

  - demo the software
  - contribute linguistic data
  - understand at a high level how the dictionary software works

There is additional developer documentation in README files scattered
throughout the codebase, as well as in comments and docstrings throughout.

  BTW this is a comment in RST

  How the toctree seems to work:

  Build up a hierachy by referencing .rst files that have their own toctree
  descriptions.
