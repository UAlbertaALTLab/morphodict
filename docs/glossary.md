analysis
===================
[analysis]: #analysis
[analyses]: #analysis
[linguistic analysis]: #analysis
[linguistic breakdown]: #analysis

_also, **linguistic analysis** or **linguistic breakdown**_.

An **ordered** set of the [lemma][] and [morphosyntactic features][]
that can describe an [inflected wordform][wordform].

It _minimally_ consists of:

 - at least one [lemma][]
 - at least one feature, stating the wordform's [word class][]

### Example

One possible linguistic analysis of the [wordform][] "sabía" in
Spanish is:

    saber+V+Pst+Past+1Sg

In other words, the breakdown is:

 - It's a form of _saber_ (the lemma)
 - It's a _verb_
 - It's _past-tense_
 - It's actor is _first-person, singular_

Contains
--------

 - **1 or more** [lemmas][]
 - **1 or more** [morphosyntactic features][]

Describes
---------

 - **1** [wordform][]; note, a single **wordform** can have multiple
   distinct analyses.


conjugation
===========
[conjugation]: #conjugation
[conjugations]: #conjugation

A type of [inflectional category][] for the verb word class.


conjugator
==========
[conjugator]: #conjugator

(_informal_) a tool that generates a [paradigm][].

N.B.: people ask for a conjugator, even when asking to generate noun
wordform!


declension
==========
[declension]: #declension

A type of [inflectional category][] for the noun word class.


definition
==========
[definition]: #definition
[definitions]: #definition

One of possibly several meanings of the [head][].

Part of
-------

-   **1** [dictionary entry][]

Describes
---------

*  **1** [head][]


derivational breakdown
======================
[derivational breakdown]: #derivational-breakdown

A derivational breakdown of a wordform contains different morphemes that makes up the wordform.

Example
--------

-   _atahkw_ + _is_ + _iw_ is the derivational breakdown of _acâhkosiwiw_
-   _star_ + _let_ + _ify_ is the derivational breakdown for the coined English word _startletify_ (to make something a little star)


derivational paradigm
=====================
[derivational paradigm]: #derivational-paradigm

The collection of all possible [derived forms] belonging to a lemma.

### Part of

 - **1** [lemma]

### Contains

 - **1** or more [wordforms]


derived form
============
[derived form]: #derived-form
[derived forms]: #derived-form

A new [wordform] created from a [lemma]; this new wordform has a separate lemma with its own [inflectional paradigm]. A derived wordform can belong to a different [word class] than the original source stem.

## Part of

 - **1** [derivational paradigm]


dictionary entry
================
[dictionary entry]: #dictionary-entry
[dictionary entries]: #dictionary-entry

The main content of a [dictionary][]. Consists of
the [head][] (in one or more [orthothographical][]
representations), the [word class][], and the
[definitions][].

Part of
-------

-  **1** [dictionary][]

Contains
--------

-   **1** [head][]
-   **1** or more [definitions][]
-   **1** [word class][], if the [head][] is a [word form][]


dictionary source
=================
[source]: #source
[dictionary source]: #dictionary-source

An edited repository of [dictionary entries]. A dictionary source has at
least one of the following:

 - an editor/editors
 - an author/authors

A dictionary sources provides at least one or more [dictionary entries].

A dictionary source may have other bibliographic metadata, like a book
or a publication.


indeclinable particle
=====================
[indeclinable particle]: #indeclinable-particle
[Ipc]: #indeclinable-particle

(In Plains Cree linguistics) The word class of [terms][] that do not
[inflect][]. Often abbreviated as [Ipc].

Is a
----

-   [word class][]


inflectional category
=====================
[inflectional category]: #inflectional-category
[inflectional categories]: #inflectional-category

A more detailed categorization of a [word class][].
Things that belong to the same inflection category have the same
affix set.

Examples
--------

-   NI-1
-   VTA-n
-   NDA-4w


inflectional paradigm
======================

[paradigm]: #inflectional-paradigm

The collection of inflected [wordforms] belonging to a lemma. Informally known as the [conjugations].

## Part of

- **1** [lemma]

## Contains

- **1** or more [wordform]


general word class
=====================
[general word class]: #general-word-class

Superclass of [word class][]. Does not contain
[inflectional categories][]. Similar
to [part of speech][].

General word classes are are not detailed
enough to tell you how its members [inflect]. A [specific word class][], on the
other hand, tells you enough to be able to [inflect].

Consists of
-----------

-   **1 or more** [word classes][]

In Plains Cree
--------------

* Noun — use the four word classes instead: [NI], [NA], [NID], [NAD]
* Verb — use the four word classes instead: [VII], [VAI], [VTI], [VTA]


gloss
=====
[gloss]: #gloss

> Note: use [translation][] instead!

Sometimes a sloppy synonym for [translation][].
More specifically, a _gloss_ is a one-to-one
mapping between one language and another, often accompanied by relevant
[tags][] for [morphosyntactic features][]. Glosses are more
specific and less "fluent" than a [translation][].


head
====
[head]: #head

The highest level structure of a [dictionary][].
Each head is listed alphabetically (with derivations (phrases on the
[wordform][]) coming after the \'root\' listing).


lemma
=====
[lemma]: #lemma
[lemmas]: #lemma
[lemmata]: #lemma

The base form of a [word form]; the form chosen to depict the basic representation of the paradigm. Often the least structurally and semantically marked form.  Unlike a [stem] or [root], a lemma is always a [word form].

### Part of

* **1** or more [word form]
* **1** [head]


morpheme
========
[morpheme]: #morpheme

The most atomic part of a wordform. A morpheme cannot be broken down into any subsequent parts.


normatize
=========
[normatize]: #normatize

Write things according to the orthographical _norm_. A norm is
implicitly and unconsciously decided by a community of writers. To
normalize the spelling of something is to make it match the spelling
expected by a community. A language may have many norms.

See also: [standardize][]

- e.g., the normative form of "alot" is "a lot"
- e.g., the normative form of "icecream" is "ice cream"
- e.g., the normative form of "atchakosuk" is "acâhkosak"


part of speech
==============
[part of speech]: #part-of-speech

> ⚠️  **Deprecated** — use [specific word class][] instead.

The grammatical category to which a [term][] belongs.
Different parts of speech have different functions in a
[clause][].

Part of
-------

-   **1** or more [word class][]
-   **1** [term][]


phrase
======
[phrase]: #phrase

Multiple [word forms][] that, together, have one [meaning][].
A [dictionary entry][] may use a phrase as a [head][].

Is composed of
--------------

-   **2 or more** [word forms][]

Can be a
--------

-   **1** [head][]


standardize
===========
[standardize]: #standardize

Write things according to the orthographical _standard_. A standard is
explicitly and consciously decided by an individual or body to be
adopted by a greater community. A language may have many standards, or
it might have no standard orthography. When there is one widely-adopted
standard, then it is also the norm: then "standardize" and "normative"
are synonymous.

See also: [normatize][]


translation
===========

[translation]: #translation

A [definition][] written in a different language than the [head][]
it is defining.


user query
==========
[user query]: #user-query


_also **query**, **search string**_.

How the user writes their _search intent_, as a series of Unicode code
points. This might be a messy, misspelled, strangely written string.
It is the job of the intelligent dictionary to take this wild thing
and make sense of it, returning results that satisfy the user's search
intent.


word class
==========
[word class]: #word-class
[word classes]: #word-class
[specific word class]: #word-class

> Also known as **specific word class**

Category of a set of terms that [inflect][] in a similar way. Members of the
same word class behave morphologically in a similar way to each other.

Contains
--------

wordform
========
[wordform]: #wordform
[wordforms]: #wordform
[word form]: #wordform
[word forms]: #wordform

In linguistics, the different ways that a word can exist in a language.
(Not to be confused with [lemma] – which is its own special type of
wordform). A wordform _must_ be able to exist by itself.


stem
====
[stem]: #stem

In linguistics, the root of a word (from which all inflected forms are
based off of).
