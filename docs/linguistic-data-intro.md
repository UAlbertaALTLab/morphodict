# Summary

To get a working dictionary application, you‚Äôll need linguistic data for
the morphodict code to use.

_**Note**: `sssttt` below refers to a [language pair abbreviation](sssttt)._

The specific kinds of required linguistic data are:

  - A dictionary in importjson format

    These files are found in `src/${sssttt}/resources/dictionary`;
    see [Where do dictionary files go?](where_dictionary_files_go).

    There is typically a full dictionary which is *not checked in* because
    it is not publicly redistributable, and a small test dictionary
    extracted from it for development and testing purposes.

    [See the complete specification for how the importjson should be formatted here.](importjson-spec)

    The dictionary is loaded into the database via the `${sssttt}-manage
    importjsondict` command.

  - Analyzer and generator FSTs in [hfstol format]

    These go in the `src/${sssttt}/resources/fst` directory,
    with the exact files configured in `settings.py`.

    A spell-relaxed analyzer FST is also strongly recommended, but if you
    do not have one, just re-use the one analyzer FST that you do have.

    We have first-class support for FSTs built in the
    [GiellaLT](https://giellalt.uit.no/) infrastructure, though other FSTs
    have also been used.

  - Paradigm layout files

    These generally go in `src/${sssttt}/resources/layouts`; see [Where to
    place paradigm layout files](where_paradigm_files_go) for more
    specifics.

    If you are editing these be sure to set a
    [`DEBUG_PARADIGM_TABLES=True`](DEBUG_PARADIGM_TABLES) environment
    variable so you don‚Äôt have restart the python server to see updates.

  - Relabellings

    FSTs have tags that only linguists know the meaning of, and often these
    tags are abbreviated in ways that only the person who made that
    particular FST fully understands.

    Relabellings map FST tags to various classes of human-understandable
    labels.

    They also confusingly map Cree word class names and give definitions
    for preverbs sometimes too, but we need to do something different and
    better for other languages.

    For example, the Plains Cree FST tag `+1Sg` can be mapped to:

      - Linguistic short: ‚Äú1s‚Äù

        Appears inside paradigm tables when ‚Äúlinguistic labels‚Äù are
        selected

      - Linguistic long: ‚ÄúActor: 1st Person Singular‚Äù

        For an FST tag, it‚Äôs not clear where this is actually used; for a
        Cree word class name, this can appear in search results, or at the
        top of a word detail page

      - English: ‚ÄúI‚Äù

        Appears inside linguistic info popup on search results,
        and in paradigm tables when ‚ÄúEnglish labels‚Äù are selected

      - n√™hiyaw√™win: ‚Äúniya‚Äù

        Appears inside paradigm tables

      - Emoji: not applicable for `+1Sg`, but for a different example,
        `+N+A` maps to ‚ÄúüßëüèΩ‚Äù

        Appears in search results, or at the top of a word detail page

    In addition to mappings for individual FST tags, the relabelling files
    allow specifying labels for *combinations* of tags, so that `+1Sg+2SgO`
    can map to ‚Äú1s ‚Üí 2s‚Äù; however it‚Äôs not clear what/how the algorithm
    works for picking exactly which combination labels are used when there
    isn‚Äôt an exact match between all the analysis tags and a single
    combination label.

# Quick note on TSV files

For editing CSV files, some people have had varying levels of success with:

  - Excel, though it might need a byte-order mark at the start of a file to
    understand input on Windows, and might interpret things as formulas and
    mangle them, so check your diffs carefully when making pull requests

  - [Easy CSV
    Editor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/easy-csv-editor/id1171346381?mt=12)
    works quite well, but is mac-only, and is not free

  - [visidata](https://www.visidata.org/) is a very powerful command-line
    data editing and exploration tool

  - There‚Äôs always vim for quick edits. You can do `:set ts=24` or
    something similar to make the tabs super obvious.

  - In PyCharm, an open TSV file actually has little Text / Data tabs at
    the bottom, which you can use to get a spreadsheet view!! However
    multiple people have had issues with this spreadsheet view not showing
    all the rows of a file.

Whatever you use to edit these TSV files, there is a handy script,
`scripts/reformat-altlabels`, that automatically evens out a TSV file
by making sure every row has the same number of tabs.

By default it will reformat every `altlab.tsv` file, but you can explicitly
give it the path to any TSV file on the command line.
